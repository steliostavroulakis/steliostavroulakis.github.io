Hello and welcome to my website. I am a PhD Student in [Computer Science](https://www.ics.uci.edu/) at [UCI](https://uci.edu/) who is extremely fortunate fo be advised by Prof. [Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io). My research interests lie at the intersection of Multi-Agent Reincorcement Learning, Game Theory and Optimization.

In reverse chronological order, I have worked on:

* Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning at [Zebra Technologies](https://www.zebra.com/us/en.html) with [Biswa Sengupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/biswasengupta).
* Privacy-Preserving Reinforcement learning at the [UCI Networking Group](https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/).
* Reinforcement Learning for Industrial Power Control, advised by [Qiuhua Huang](https://energyenvironment.pnnl.gov/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=2957) at the [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/reinforcement-learning-grid-control) 
* Music information retrieval algorithms [[demo]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q0xlF2VNSs6NVh8FSPA0nydCw3x_e6Nb/view) [[ISMIR '17 paper]](https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/135_Paper.pdf) at the Language & Speech Processing Institute of the [Athena Research and Innovation Center](https://www.athenarc.gr/en). 

I received my Diploma in EECS from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Technical_University_of_Athens). For more information about me, see my [CV](https://steliostavroulakis.github.io/files/CV_Stelios_Stavroulakis.pdf) or [contact](https://steliostavroulakis.github.io/contact) me.

My origin is from Rethymno and I grew up in Athens, Greece. If you'd like to visit Crete, ask me for recommendations!

News
======

* **June 2022** - Submitted my MS thesis entitled ["Computing Nash Equilibria in Adversarial Stochastic Team Games"](https://steliostavroulakis.github.io/files/MS_Thesis_UCI.pdf). Code containing algorithm implementation and multi-agent RL environment can be found [here](https://github.com/steliostavroulakis/AdversarialTeamGames).

* **May 2022** - Participated in the [Learning and Games](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/games2022) program at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. Particularly enjoyed the [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Bandit Learning](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/games2022-3) Workshop.

* **March 2022** - Our paper entitled [Reinforcement Learning for Location-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03480) got accepted at the inaugural ICLR 2022 Workshop on [Generalizable Policy Learning in Physical World](https://ai-workshops.github.io/generalizable-policy-learning-in-the-physical-world/).

* **July 2021** - Completed the [Reinforcement Learning specialization](https://coursera.org/share/79e65992652227a9c3872d9ea3a031a3) offered by the [University of Alberta](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning). This was probably one of the most organized and well-crafted courses I have ever taken.
