Hello and welcome to my website. I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at UCI, advised by Prof. [Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io). My research interests lie at the intersection of Multi-Agent Reincorcement Learning, Game Theory and Optimization.

In inverse chronological order, I worked on Privacy-Preserving Reinforcement learning at the [UCI Networking Group](https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/), Reinforcement Learning for Industrial Power Control, advised by [Qiuhua Huang](https://energyenvironment.pnnl.gov/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=2957) and signal processing and music information retrieval [[demo]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q0xlF2VNSs6NVh8FSPA0nydCw3x_e6Nb/view)[[ISMIR '17 paper]](https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/135_Paper.pdf).

My origin is from Rethymno and I grew up in Athens, Greece. If you'd like to visit Crete, you should ask me for recommendations.

For more information about me, see my CV or contact me.
